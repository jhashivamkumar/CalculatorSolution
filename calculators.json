    "explanation":"Percentage calculations are among the most common arithmetic tasks in finance and daily life. This calculator helps with core percentage operations: finding what percentage one number is of another, computing the absolute or relative percent change between two numbers, and applying percentage increases or decreases to base amounts. The tool is valuable for quickly computing discounts, markups, commission rates, tax calculations, and simple financial comparisons. The interface keeps inputs clear and produces immediate results to minimize errors. It is especially useful for small business owners, students, and shoppers who want a reliable, fast answer without complex spreadsheets. The calculator is pure client-side code so it works offline in modern browsers and loads quickly — both important for SEO and user engagement.",

      {"q":"What is percent increase?","a":"Percent increase compares the difference to the original value: ((new-old)/old)*100."},
      {"q":"Can the calculator handle negative percentages?","a":"Yes. Negative results show a decrease or negative change."},
      {"q":"Is this tool accurate for finance?","a":"It gives accurate mathematical results; for legal or tax calculations consult an accountant."}

    "explanation":"Body Mass Index (BMI) is a quick screening tool that uses a person’s height and weight to estimate body fat for most adults. This calculator supports metric and imperial units and displays the numeric BMI along with category guidance such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obesity. While BMI is useful for population-level screening, it does not measure body fat directly and may not reflect muscle mass or distribution. Use it as a general indicator and consult health professionals for individualized advice. The calculator is designed for speed and clarity: enter weight and height, switch units if needed, and get instant results. The page includes formula details and frequently asked questions to help users understand implications and limitations of BMI as a health metric.",

      {"q":"Is BMI a perfect measure of health?","a":"No. BMI is a screening tool and doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution."},
      {"q":"What BMI is considered healthy?","a":"A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally considered normal for adults."},
      {"q":"Can athletes have high BMI?","a":"Yes, muscular individuals can have higher BMI but low body fat."},
      {"q":"Does age affect BMI interpretation?","a":"Yes. For children and teens, BMI is age- and sex-specific. For adults, standard ranges are used."},

    "explanation":"The Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is the fixed payment a borrower makes to a lender each month to repay a loan within a certain tenure. This calculator computes EMI based on loan amount, annual interest rate and number of months (or years). It also provides the total payment and total interest paid over the loan term. This tool helps borrowers compare loan offers and plan budgets. The calculation uses the standard amortization formula and assumes fixed interest rate for the loan duration. Use it to estimate monthly cashflow and to compare scenarios such as shorter tenures (higher EMI, lower interest) vs longer tenures (lower EMI, higher interest). Always verify with lender statements for exact schedules and prepayment rules.",

      {"q":"What is EMI?","a":"EMI is a fixed monthly payment to repay loan principal and interest over tenure."},
      {"q":"How do interest rates affect EMI?","a":"Higher interest rates increase EMI and total interest paid."},
      {"q":"Can I prepay part of my loan?","a":"Depends on lender — prepayment reduces principal and future interest, but check charges."},
      {"q":"Does loan tenure change interest paid?","a":"Longer tenure lowers EMI but increases total interest paid."},
      {"q":"Is EMI same as total cost?","a":"No. Total cost = EMI * n. Interest portion = total cost - principal."}
