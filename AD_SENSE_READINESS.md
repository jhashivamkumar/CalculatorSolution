AdSense Readiness Checklist

This checklist helps prepare the site for Google AdSense review and to maximise approval chances.

- [x] Privacy Policy page present and linked in footer
- [x] Contact & About pages present and linked
- [x] Sitemap available at `/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Unique, helpful content on key pages (consider adding short articles explaining calculators)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout and fast load times (use Lighthouse to test)
- [ ] Easy site navigation and internal linking
- [ ] No adult, copyrighted, or disallowed content
- [ ] Domain ownership verified in Google Search Console
- [ ] Clean ad placements placeholders (don’t obstruct content) and comply with AdSense policies

Recommended next steps:
- Add 1–2 short articles (300–800+ words) tied to top calculators (e.g., "How EMI works", "Understanding BMI") to demonstrate value.
- Run Lighthouse and fix accessibility/performance issues (reduce blocking CSS, compress images, add caching headers on server).
- Once Search Console is connected and site content is sufficient, apply for AdSense and follow their implementation instructions.

Notes:
- This file is a guide. AdSense decisions are made by Google and depend on multiple signals beyond technical readiness.
